Munin is great application for monitoring the status of your server!
http://munin.projects.linpro.no/

We have created two modules for tracking your app_konference application


conferences - this gives you the total number of conferences at any given time

members - this gives you the total number of members in all conferences at any given time

INSTALL
to install these modules copy them to (on gentoo) /etc/munin/plugins

You must then run the plugins as the same user as you run asterisk.
This is required since "asterisk -rx" is required.  to do this (On Gentoo)

/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node

add the following lines (Change root to the username asterisk is running under if required)

[conferences]
user root

[members]
user root


That's it munin will now start logging your app_konference application
